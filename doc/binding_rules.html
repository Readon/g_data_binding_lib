<span style="color:red">IMPORTANT!</span> There is a live demonstration of these flags in 
demo_and_tutorial which comes in same project. This is probably much easier to understand when
looking at it visually
</p><p>
<h3>DEFAULT</h3>
Specifies data transfer is only done from <b>Source</b> to <b>Target</b> and there is no initial
data synchronization at the moment when connection is established. Unless <b>BIDIRECTIONAL</b>
is specified all data changes to <b>Target</b> will be ignored. The one case when this is not so
is if connection also specifies <b>REVERSE_DIRECTION</b> in which case main direction is from
<b>Target</b> to <b>Source</b>
<h3>SYNC_CREATE</h3>
Specifies data synchronization at the moment when connection is established (this also means time
of connection unfreeze). Data synchronization is based on other specified rules. If one of rules
is also <b>REVERSE_DIRECTION</b>, this changes synchronization to be from <b>Target</b> to 
<b>Source</b> instead of usual <b>Source</b> to <b>Target</b>. Other flag that can change how
synchronization is done is <b>INVERT_BOOLEAN</b> which if specified negates the boolean value on
synchronization.
<h3>BIDIRECTIONAL</h3>
Specifies data transfer between properties on changes is going in both directions. Note that main 
synchronization direction will still be in single direction as defined by flag priority. With
<b>BIDIRECTIONAL</b> data is transferred as soon as change notification is propagated from either
side
<h3>INVERT_BOOLEAN</h3>
Specifies that any boolean value should be inverted on data transfer which makes it convenient to
automate inverted conditions
<h3>REVERSE_DIRECTION</h3>
Inverts direction where it declares that main point of data is <b>Target</b> and not <b>Source</b>
as in default conditions. Unless <b>BIDIRECTIONAL</b> was specified this plays role in which data
is transferred or synchronized.
<h3>MANUAL_EVENTS_FROM_SOURCE</h3>
Disables all notifications from <b>Source</b> and data is only updated when application manually
calls <b>update_from_source()</b>. This is useful when live data change in object is not desired
action
<h3>MANUAL_EVENTS_FROM_TARGET</h3>
Disables all notifications from <b>Target</b> and data is only updated when application manually
calls <b>update_from_target()</b>. This is useful when live data change in object is not desired
action
<h3>MANUAL_UPDATE</h3>
This is simple combination of both <b>MANUAL_EVENTS_FROM_SOURCE</b> and <b>MANUAL_EVENTS_FROM_TARGET</b>
<h3>INACTIVE</h3>
<span style="color:red">IMPORTANT!</span> Unlike all other flags, this is the only flag that can 
change during lifetime. One example of that change is if binding is frozen from application side
and changes again when application unfreezes same binding. If this flag is specified at the binding
creation, then binding starts in inactive mode where nothing including synchronization is emitted
until its state changes
<h3>SOURCE_UPDATE_FLOOD_DETECTION, TARGET_UPDATE_FLOOD_DETECTION</h3>
<a href="what_is_flood_detection.html">What is flood detection and why would I care?</a>
<p>When writing responsive applications or just being careful about cpu usage in application this
flag can mean a lot. This flag main purpose is to control <b>Active</b> bindings, but it can be
used for other purposes as well.
</p>
<p>One example case where this is really handy is when group of connections tracks currently
selected object. Problem which can arise is that if user keeps scrolling over items, application
can take large hit on cpu as it has to reestablish all connections to new target. This is when
flood detection comes handy. If specified amount of consecutive refreshes are lower than specified
flood interval, binding emits flood start and emits flood end once this is over. By default
once flood is active changes are simply ignored and only continued on end of message spam. While
this action does not need signals by default, signals can come handy in order to present situation
in correct way (demo_and_tutorial for example grays out label and changes its title to "Flood in
progress" for the duration of flood).
</p>
<h3>FLOOD_DETECTION</h3>
<a href="what_is_flood_detection.html">What is flood detection and why would I care?</a>
<p>This is simple combination of both <b>SOURCE_UPDATE_FLOOD_DETECTION</b> and <b>TARGET_UPDATE_FLOOD_DETECTION</b></p>
<h3>SOURCE_DELAYED, TARGET_DELAYED</h3>
Similar to flood detection this provides static delay to data transfer if another event occurs 
during delay, delay is prolonged for another delay_interval. example usecase is binding search 
controls where you don't want to spam search requests
<h3>DELAYED</h3>
This is simple combination of both <b>SOURCE_DELAYED</b> and <b>TARGET_DELAYED</b>
<h3>CUSTOM_EVENTS_ONLY</h3>
Suppresses connection to to original notification and only uses custom specified events. Unlike
<b>MANUAL_UPDATE</b> this still uses any additionally specified notifications and signals
<h3>SUPPRESS_WARNINGS</h3>
In normal mode binding when impossible reports errors to console, but sometimes "try or fail"
approach comes handy and this is when this flag should be used. In case of failed binding
creation no error is reported to console and only thing that happens is the fact that <b>bind</b>
returns <b>null</b> result
<h3>USE_ORIGINAL_SOURCE_TYPE, USE_ORIGINAL_TARGET_TYPE</h3>
<p>g_data_binding_lib comes with handy resolving when some object is not really represented by its
own data, but instead binding should be used on some of its internals same as property discovery.
These flags make it possible to still access original object if needed as redirection will not
happen</p>
<p>Simplest case of this is looking at <b>GSettings</b> object. Its own properties do not
reflect his data that would most probably be edited in 99.9% of the time. This is why binding
allows to redirect to that by default, but in remote case when binding actually needs to be done
at original property, these flags allow to do so</p>
<h3>USE_ORIGINAL_TYPES</h3>
This is simple combination of both <b>USE_ORIGINAL_SOURCE_TYPE</b> and <b>USE_ORIGINAL_TARGET_TYPE</b>
<h3>DEBUG</h3>
This is not opposite from <b>SUPPRESS_WARNINGS</b> as main purpose is to debug certain binding
to get notified about absolutely everything happening internally. As such connection bind/unbind,
data transfer and everything gets logged into console. This should not be enabled unless there is
a need for it and disabled as soon as it is not needed anymore
