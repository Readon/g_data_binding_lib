<h1>What is PropertyBinding and what is its purpose</h1>
<a href="index.html">Back to main page</a>
<h2>Property binding freeze()/unfreeze()</h2>
<p>this allows fine control over when to process messages and when not. each freeze() increments freeze counter and binding is not unfrozen until 
there is equivalent amount of unfreeze() calls at which point CREATE_SYNC is renewed</p>
<p>there are two freeze(bool) levels</p>
<li>soft (keeps property signals and ignores transfer, safe to employ in every occasion)</li>
<li>hard (removes signals until unfrozen, requires thinking if this is suitable or not)</li>
<p>depending on situation one might be cheaper than another and order of soft/hard does not matter. hard superseeds soft and unfreeze() restores both</p>
<h2>Q&A</h2>
<p><b>Q. GLib already has binding, why not just use that one?</b></p>
<p>A. Short answer... the one in GLib simply has no functionality that is needed and trying to go in political debates
to get changes approved would seriously slow down this project</p>
<p>Long answer... At the beginning <b>g_data_binding_lib</b> used exactly that. <b>PropertyBinding</b> is introduced for 
few reasons, but most importantly because <b>GBinding</b> cannot produce all needed binding
possibilities like flood detection, delayed/reverse binding or manual update and there is my unwillingness to go into debate why this would be 
useful until i have concrete example. (at the risk of sounding pretentious here, but my head simply hurts when person on the other
side does not see the whole picture and whole thing becomes nonsense talk when two sides don't even speak same thing. full
picture is much easier to convey when there is concrete example and I really suck with words)</p>
<p>Another case why is the fact that this way I can support older GLib versions, where support if this was part of GLib would
be limited to inclusion data</p>
<p>API is more or less exactly the same as <b>GBinding</b> so if needed, adding same functionality to <b>GBinding</b> is trivial which would 
allow to completely remove <b>PropertyBinding</b> <b>which is something i would very much prefer after this is ironed out</b>. This
wish doesn't come without drawback though. If I tried that, this would come to really hard decision what to propose. Just proposing
changes to <b>GBinding</b> would be 1/10th of solution. There are quite a few things that would need to be proposed as well where I
hardly doubt they all would be approved</p>
