<p><span style="color:blue;"><i>(this is also valid for contracts since contract is derived from pointer)</i></span> relaying of binding pointers is used to extend the automatism
for source propagation in order to minimize application code and adds possibility of more complex designed data maps as this can
create subcontract/subpointer that gets controlled by its main contract.
relays can be used in various ways
- source redirection
- data transfer handling modification (note that this is only valid for pointers specifiying MANUAL data transfer)</p>
