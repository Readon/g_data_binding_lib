<h1>What is Binder and what is its purpose</h1>
<a href="index.html">Back to main page</a>
<p>property aliases allow easier binding across the application. example: one of the annoying things when you build gui per need in
application life span is knowing which property in gui widget is handling data. Gtk.Entry has "text", Gtk.Label has "label" and there.
is simply no other way than tedious discovery. alias registration can also provide blind type safety with correct use as it is possible 
to register "string:text" on all objects that support it and not on those that don't</p>
<p>this allows registration of other than &amp; alias property names like for example "alias:text", where whole string is custom and not defined in any way.
be aware that if alias clashes with real property name, real property takes precedence</p>
