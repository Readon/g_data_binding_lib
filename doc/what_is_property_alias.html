<h1>What is PropertyAlias and what is its purpose?</h1>
<a href="index.html">Back to main page</a>
<p>Problem at hand. When trying to automate how bindings are mapped, there is often inconsistency where property names cannot be predictable.
Case in point example in Gtk is property name in widget which is responsible to handle data content</p>
<p>As such in Gtk there is</p>
<li><b>label</b> property in <b>GtkLabel</b></li>
<li><b>text</b> property in <b>GtkEntry</b></li>
<li><b>active</b> property in <b>GtkCheckBox</b></li>
<li>... most widgets use their own property which is named differently than in the rest ...</li>
<p>First and foremost, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that as this makes widgets easier to work with when handling them manually.
Problem only shows when this same thing is tried to be approached from different side which is not really working with them directly.
In case of <b>g_data_binding_lib</b> most serious example would be <a href="what_is_mapper.html">Mapper objects</a> or 
<a href="what_is_default_widgets.html">DefaultWidgets</a></p>
<p>This is where PropertyAlias gets its value. It enables possibility to register same property under different name. As such it is easy
to consolidate all properties with same workload under the same name and still keep the good side of properly named properties for 
manual work</p>
<p>Mainly, property aliases allow easier binding across the application. example: one of the annoying things when you build gui per need in
application life span is knowing which property in gui widget is handling data. This allows registration of property names like for example 
"alias:text", where whole string is custom and not defined in any way.</p>
<p>Functionality does not end with just widget property name. It is usable for many other things like reporting or list displayes where data
being shown is not necessarily of the same type</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Defining custom alias is pretty much straight forward</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>	PropertyAlias.get_instance("alias:text")
		.register (typeof(Gtk.Entry), "text")
		.register (typeof(Gtk.Label), "label");
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>This would register two aliases for "alias:text". One for GtkEntry under "text" and one for GtkLabel under "label"</p>
<p>While resolving is again really simple</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>	string my_alias = PropertyAlias.get_instance("alias:text")
		.safe_get_for (typeof(Gtk.Entry), "text");
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>	string my_alias = PropertyAlias.get_alias_property_for("alias:text", typeof(GtkEntry));
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>There are few things to be noted.</p>
<li><b>get_instance()</b> automatically creates alias group, so <b>get_instance()</b> can never return <b>null</b>.
If this is for some reason unwanted application can call <b>bool PropertyAlias.contains(alias)</b> and avoid creation</li>
<li><b>safe_get_for(...)</b> specifies original value as well for safety reasons and if alias is not found for specified type, that one is returned.
If this is not necessary then <b>get_for(...)</b> can be used</li>
<li><b>PropertyAlias</b> already contains calls for <b>get_default_value_property_for</b>, <b>get_visibility_property_for</b> and 
<b>get_sensitivity_property_for</b></li>
<h2>Runtime inspection</h2>
<p><a href="what_is_binding_inspector.html">Binding inspector</a> can be used to inspect all registrations during application run</p>
<h2>Usage in g_data_binding_lib</h2>
<p>Most important is the use in <a href="what_is_default_widgets.html">DefaultWidgets</a> where <b>DefaultWidgets.init()</b> registers most
common widgets for 3 aliases</p>
<li><b>map::alias::default-value-property</b> which is registered for widgets data content property (defined const is <b>ALIAS_DEFAULT</b>)</li>
<li><b>map::alias::visibility</b> which is registered for widgets visibility property (defined const is <b>ALIAS_VISIBILITY</b>)</li>
<li><b>map::alias::sensitivity</b> which is registered for widgets sensitivity property (defined const is <b>ALIAS_SENSITIVITY</b>)</li>
<p>Note that both <b>visible</b> and <b>sensitive</b> are already done in the way that would not require the registration. Those two are
more or less only registered in order to be able to be accessed the same as some foreign objects which could as well have them, but under
different names</p>
<p><b>Be aware that if alias clashes with real property name, real property takes precedence. Alias is also valid for all the subclasses unless
overridden specifically</b></p>
