<h1>What is binding state object and what is its purpose?</h1>
<a href="index.html">Back to main page</a>
<p>Main purpose of state objects is giving possibility of static state binding (control of partial visibility/sensitivity would probably
rank between better case) and completely remove all need to track which source is now active. State object refreshes whenever either
source in application. changes or notification for one of its registered properties was emitted. this allows having single simple 
<b>PropertyBinding</b> or plain <b>Binder</b> mappint to buttons like Apply or other similar 
conditions.</p>
<p>This also simplifies bindings as main objects don't need to be cluttered with all sorts of random properties to support all the needed
checks as binding state objects can be added/removed per contract on a whim</p>
