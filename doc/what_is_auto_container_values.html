<h1>What is AutoContainerValues and what is its purpose</h1>
<a href="index.html">Back to main page</a>
<p><b>AutoContainerValues</b> is one of <b>g_data_binding_gtk_lib</b> auto layouting options whose main
objective is to be able to create lightweight widgets that are oriented either horizontally or vertically.
Most notable usage is probably auto creation and filling of ListBox models which when combined with the
fact that it supports work trough <b>SizeGroupCollection</b> makes it very versatile widget.</p>
<p><b>It should be noted that optimization for cached rebuilds of same container is on TODO list</b></p>
