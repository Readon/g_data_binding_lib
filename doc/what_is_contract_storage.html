<h1>What is ContractStorage and what is its purpose</h1>
<a href="index.html">Back to main page</a>
<p>Binding contract storage serves as storage point for contracts that are accessible by name (string) or to just have one reference kept
alive when local variable is unwanted.</p>
<p>It also allows easy access to pointers without the need to obfuscate code with either having to keep passing contract as parameter 
for methods or have code referencing to it self all over the project. good design often leads to situations where all GUI parts need
to follow current situation from otherwise separated code</p>
<p>Both</p>
<li>using <b>ContractStorage</b> for reference holding. Storing it into storage automatically guarantees holding of one reference to
keep object alive</li>
<li>using <b>ContractStorage</b> to access same contract from unrelated parts of code</li>
<p>are intended ways of usage</p>
<p>Note that that unlike <b>PointerStorage</b> which can hold pointers as well as contract, <b>ContractStorage</b> cannot do that. Only
thing allowed to be stored is BindingContract and its subclassses</p>
<h1>ContractStorage runtime inspection</h1>
<p>Among other things pointers stored in storage can be easily accessed for inspection in <a href="what_is_binding_inspector.html">Binding inspector</a>
trough its search options where beside manual search by name or id there are also pages to search manually trough <b>PointerStorage</b> and <b>ContractStorage</b></p>
