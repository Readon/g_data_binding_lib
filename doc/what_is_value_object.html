<h1>What is Binder and what is its purpose</h1>
<a href="index.html">Back to main page</a>
<p>much like state objects, main purpose of value objects is giving possibility of static binding and completely remove all need to
track which source is now active. Value object refreshes whenever either source in application. changes or notification for one of 
its registered properties was emitted. this allows having single simple PropertyBinding to specific value that is automatically updated
this also simplifies bindings as main objects don't need to be cluttered with all sorts of random properties to support all the needed
functionality per case. value objects can be added/removed per contract on a whim</p>
