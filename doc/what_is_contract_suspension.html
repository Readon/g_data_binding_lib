<h1>What is contract suspension and what it is used for?</h1>
<a href="index.html">Back to main page</a>
<p>In short... Main purpose of suspension is providing another way for contract to control gui and data flow. When contract is suspended
so are all its binding rules and no binding will take effect until contracts suspended state is lifted. When lifted contract binding rules
take effect again and contract enables them if that is possible in current situation</p>
<p>Each contract has simple property</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>	bool <b>suspended</b> { get; set; }
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>which defines whether contract is active or not (note that contract can be invalid even when not suspended as suspended state is not
connected with validity of bindings.</p>
<p>When <b>suspended</b> is set to true, contract instantly releases all active bindings it holds and goes in dormant state, once contract is 
unsuspended bindings are instantly restored and active if that is possible</p>
<p><b>NOTE!</b></p>
<p>For group maintainance of <b>suspended</b> there is a possibility to use class <b>BindingSuspensionGroup</b> which allows setting <b>suspended</b> 
for all contracts in that group. note that trying to manually set that property is not possible</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Maintenance over single contract</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>	// create binding contract
	my_contract = new BindingContract();
	// control suspended state
	my_contract.suspended = true;
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>Maintenance over multiple contracts with group</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>	// same control can be achieved by grouping more contracts
	contract1_in_group = new BindingContract();
	contract2_in_group = new BindingContract();
	// create suspension group
	suspension_group = new BindingSuspensionGroup();
	// add both contracts to group
	suspension_group.add (contract1_in_group);
	suspension_group.add (contract2_in_group);
	// now suspension can be controlled from group object
	suspension_group.suspended = true;
</code></pre></blockquote>
