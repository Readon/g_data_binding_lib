<h1>What is PointerStorage and what is its purpose</h1>
<a href="index.html">Back to main page</a>
<p>Binding pointer storage serves as storage point for pointers that are accessible by name (string) or to just have one reference kept
alive when local variable is unwanted.</p>
<p>It also allows easy access to pointers without the need to obfuscate code with either having to keep passing pointer as parameter 
for methods or have code referencing to it self all over the project. good design often leads to situations where all GUI parts need
to follow current situation from otherwise separated code</p>
<p>Both</p>
<li>using <b>PointerStorage</b> for reference holding. Storing it into storage automatically guarantees holding of one reference to
keep object alive</li>
<li>using <b>PointerStorage</b> to access same pointer from unrelated parts of code</li>
<p>are intended ways of usage</p>
<p>Note that contract can be stored in <b>PointerStorage</b> as well, not just in <b>ContractStorage</b> since <b>BindingContract</b>
is derived from <b>BindingPointer</b> which is type stored in <b>PointerStorage</b></p>
<h1>PointerStorage runtime inspection</h1>
<p>Among other things pointers stored in storage can be easily accessed for inspection in <a href="what_is_binding_inspector.html">Binding inspector</a>
trough its search options where beside manual search by name or id there are also pages to search manually trough <b>PointerStorage</b> and <b>ContractStorage</b></p>
