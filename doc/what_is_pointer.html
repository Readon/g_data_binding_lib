<h1>What is data binding pointer?</h1>
<a href="index.html">Back to main page</a>
<p>Pointers mainly only serve as base for <a href="what_is_contract.html">Contract</a>, although they have many
other uses as well. Sometimes <a href="what_is_contract.html">Contract</a> is just unnecessary for certain uses
while sometimes it is much easier to extend <b>Pointer</b> than <a href="what_is_contract.html">Contract</a>.
One case of such extensions are relaying pointers which only serve to relay <b>source</b> to different object
</p>
<p>Binding pointer is easier to understand if it is compared to regular pointers. All that regular pointer does
is pointing to address of where data exists. Exact same thing goes for binding pointers with one exception.
Beside just pointing to data it also provides complete signal system that can be used to track changes.

<h2>Properties</h2>
<h3>property Object? data { get; set; }</h3>
Pointer value, but since that could be another pointer pointing to another pointer and so on, this is not
really application friendly. Application when needed should use method <b>get_source()</b> which resolves
complete chain and returns absolute end of chain no matter how complex 
<h2>Signals</h2>
<h3>signal void before_source_change (BindingPointer source, bool same_type, Object? next_source);</h3>
This signal happens just in a moment before pointer will start pointing elsewhere.
<h3>signal void source_changed (BindingPointer source);</h3>
Signal is emitted as first thing when data changes
<h3>signal void connect_notifications (Object? obj);</h3>
When connecting things like contract bindings, this is probably most convenient time. Not only source is
already resolved, it is also guaranteed safe moment when dispatch of <b>source_changed</b> already occurred
<h3>signal void disconnect_notifications (Object? obj);</h3>
When disconnecting things like contract bindings this is again best time to do it.
<h3>signal void data_changed (BindingPointer source, string data_change_cookie);</h3>
