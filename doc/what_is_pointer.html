<h1>What is data binding pointer?</h1>
<a href="index.html">Back to main page</a>
<p><b>BindingPointer</b> is the corner stone of complex databinding in this project and it is absolute 
<span style="color:red"><b><u><b>MUST UNDERSTAND</b></u></b></span> in order to proceed with <b>Active</b>
data bindings. Not understanding it would only lead to not understanding everything else including 
the design of this project</p>
<p></p><b>NOTE! BindingProperty intentionally doesn't work by treating BindingPointers as advanced contract binding does and treats 
just as any other object type. This is a feature, not a bug!</b></p>
<p>Pointers mainly only serve as base for <a href="what_is_contract.html">Contract</a>, although they have many
other uses as well. Sometimes <a href="what_is_contract.html">Contract</a> is just unnecessary for certain uses
while sometimes it is much easier to extend <b>Pointer</b> than <a href="what_is_contract.html">Contract</a>.
One case of such extensions are relaying pointers which only serve to relay <b>source</b> to different object as 
well as enabling ease of customized subclasses (also read little Q&A after explanation)
</p>
<p>Binding pointer is easier to understand if it is compared to regular pointers. All that regular pointer does
is pointing to address of where data exists. Exact same thing goes for binding pointers with one exception.
Beside just pointing to data it also provides complete signal system that can be used to track changes when they
are redirected to any other data in any way possible.
</p>
<p>Pointers destination is assigned to <b>data</b> property, but due to the nature how they work <b>data</b> is
not reliable way to discern destination. Real destination can be resolved with <b>get_source()</b> method. Second
example shows exactly that situation where pointer points to another pointer which points to data object. In that
case, even though their <b>data</b> differs, destination is the same. It should be noted that in most cases unless
implementing custom internals, <b>get_source()</b> is not really needed on application side. Only case when that is
so is when application wants to use it for some reason.</p>

</object><small><p>Simple pointer-data relationship</p></small>
</div></p>
<p>Code that produces this result</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>	BindingPointer my_pointer = new BindingPointer(my_data_object);
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>This is exact same effect as</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>	BindingPointer my_pointer = new BindingPointer(null);
	my_pointer.data = my_data_object;
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>In this case pointers <b>data</b> property simply points to some object. Whenever <b>data</b> is redirected
elsewhere pointer emits following signals that can be connected from any client</p>
<li><b>disconnect_notifications</b> - note that this only happens if pointer was pointing to valid data</li>
<li><b>before_source_change</b> - note that this only happens if pointer was pointing to valid data</li>
<li><b>source_changed</b> - note that this only happens if pointer is now pointing to valid data</li>
<li><b>connect_notifications</b> - note that this only happens if pointer is now pointing to valid data</li>
<p>As much as this seems unwarranted at first glance, it is not. <b>BindingPointer</b> and <b>BindingContract</b> take advantage
of this tractability since they automatically connect to these notifications and redeploy them to their clients
when relationship is not simple pointer-data</p>
<p><b>Complex chained pointer relationships</b></p>
<p>In most cases application can be defined as complex tree of relationships and taking advantage of
this automatism.</p>

</object><small><p>More complex pointer-pointer-data relationship</p></small></div></p>
<p>Code that produces this result</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>	BindingPointer my_pointer = new BindingPointer(my_data_object);
	BindingPointer my_client_pointer = new BindingPointer (my_pointer);
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>In this case there are two pointers. One is not pointing to actual data, but rather it is pointing to
another pointer which does point to active data.</p>
<p>Whenever middle pointer is updated, all the notifications and all the tractability is passed to his
client pointer as well.</p>
<p><b>Why would this be useful and why pointing to same data when it could be just one point from beginnging?</b></p>
<li>For one, separating application in smaller parts is always big benefit and by having same data always reliably
synchronized is another big benefit</li>
<li>Two parts of software can handle same data differently with different validations and different needs</li>
<li><b>It does not need to be same data at all</b>. When any pointer uses redirection it will point to completely different
object and at the same time he will be updated every time when his command chain says to do so. Case and point
example of this is <b>BindingPointerFromPropertyValue</b> which instead of propagating data (or end of its chain) adds another
thing to the table. It looks up if specified property is available in currently pointed source data and proclaims
value of that property as its own end of chain (or in case if that is another pointer it returns end of that chain)</li>
<p><b>Creating first binding tree structure (static data pipeline)</b></p>
<p>Before basic diagram scheme this should most probably require simplification. Best case for that are
database foreign keys. When two tables are connected with foreign key it basically creates static known point
of how two different data objects relate and which object from second table is relevant for object in table
specifiying foreign key</p>
<p>And binding pointer static pipeline is exactly that. By preemptive description of relations application
can reliably know what is available, how it is available and what it should do without code intervention</p>

</object><small><p>Tree like data relationship pipeline</p></small>
</div></p>
<p>Code that produces this result</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>	BindingPointer my_pointer = new BindingPointer(my_data_object);
	BindingPointerFromPropertyValue my_boss_pointer = new BindingPointerFromPropertyValue(my_pointer, "boss");
	BindingPointerFromPropertyValue my_company_pointer = new BindingPointerFromPropertyValue(my_pointer, "company");
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>While this diagram might look scary it is not. It is perfectly simple.</p>
<li>There is one main binding pointer which can reliably control everything (green).</li>
<li>There are two pointers connected to main pointer, but instead of simply providing same object as main pointer,
they each relay their source to respective property they handle.</li>
<li>At no point do client pointers need to be updated as this will happen each time change occurs. Be it that main
pointer starts pointing to one of B,C,D persons or managing property in currently handled object changed (boss is changed in company or
persons employment object is changed)</li>
<li>In case when main pointer points to person who is also boss of that company, both main and "boss" connected
pointer will point at the same data</li>
<li>In case of main pointer pointing to <b>null</b> (or object that doesn't contain respective property) both client
pointers will be notified about invalidity</li>
<li>In case if there would be 5th person that is not employed, "company" client pointer would be <b>null</b></li>
<p><b>This static pipeline can now be used as simple as possible.</b> There is only one interaction point (main pointer) while
everything else is automated</p>
<p>
<h2>Q&A</h2>
<p><b>Q. If pointers don't do anything but point to data, why would I use them?</b></p>
<p>A. In most cases, you wouldn't. In most cases <b>BindingContract</b> will be far better choice</p>
<p><b>Q. If that is so, then why Pointers? Why not simply go with contracts?</b></p>
<p>A. Stuffing contract functionality at low level would only hamper the design and flexibility. Keeping <b>BindingPointer</b>
simple is good for custom extensions of data redirection like <b>BindingPointerFromPropertyValue</b> or <b>ThrottlingBindingPointer</b>. Wheter it is
redirection or event dispatch customization, it is far better to have simple extendable class than having one that
is requiring you to break things in order to get it done.</p>
<p>And there is a fact that simply chaining contract(pointer) is most basic thing possible. This gives all benefits
of simple design as well as absolute customization possibilities and at the same time retain full functionality</p>
<p>Based that <b>BindingContract</b> is just subclass of <b>BindingPointer</b> everything learned here is also valid
for contracts where only thing that needs to be added is knowing that extra functionality</p>
<p><b>Q. Is there any other benefit when using pointers as chain links?</b></p>
<p>A. Yes, less memory use, less signals. In short, more efficient application</p>
<p><b>Q. Isn't that too much signaling? What if I iterate fast over items?</b></p>
<p>A. Not even remotely. It has all signals for all states that need to be dispatched in order to have clean design
upwards. For example of fast iteration, solutions are trivial at best. Subclass <b>BindingPointer</b> to use as your own custom chain link
and track source changes in a way where you either set pointers <b>suspended</b> property to true or simply stop
changing source until certain delay between changes shows up and then set up last promoted source. In fact by having
good static data pipeline, there is nothing easier to reflect that in gui as well. This is exactly one of the reasons
why there is <b>BindingPointer</b> and there is <b>BindingContract</b>. To create extensions like this as trivial as
they can be</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>
<h3>property Object? data { get; set; }</h3>
Pointer value, but since that could be another pointer pointing to another pointer and so on, this is not
really application friendly. Application when needed should use method <b>get_source()</b> which resolves
complete chain and returns absolute end of chain no matter how complex 
<h2>Signals</h2>
<h3>signal void before_source_change (BindingPointer source, bool same_type, Object? next_source);</h3>
This signal happens just in a moment before pointer will start pointing elsewhere.
<h3>signal void source_changed (BindingPointer source);</h3>
Signal is emitted as first thing when data changes
<h3>signal void connect_notifications (Object? obj);</h3>
When connecting things like contract bindings, this is probably most convenient time. Not only source is
already resolved, it is also guaranteed safe moment when dispatch of <b>source_changed</b> already occurred
<h3>signal void disconnect_notifications (Object? obj);</h3>
When disconnecting things like contract bindings this is again best time to do it.
<h3>signal void data_changed (BindingPointer source, string data_change_cookie);</h3>
<h3>method Object? get_source();</h3>
This method is probably only pointer method that needs to be remembered. This method always resolves data
at the end of the specified chain no matter how complex that chain is.
