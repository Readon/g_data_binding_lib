<h1>What is data binding pointer?</h1>
<a href="index.html">Back to main page</a>
<p>Pointers mainly only serve as base for <a href="what_is_contract.html">Contract</a>, although they have many
other uses as well. Sometimes <a href="what_is_contract.html">Contract</a> is just unnecessary for certain uses
while sometimes it is much easier to extend <b>Pointer</b> than <a href="what_is_contract.html">Contract</a>.
One case of such extensions are relaying pointers which only serve to relay <b>source</b> to different object
