<h1>What is data binding source?</h1>
<a href="index.html">Back to main page</a>
<p>There are always two sides of data binding that needs to be provided <b>Source</b> and <b>Target</b>.
When defining new binding both have to provided in order to enable the connection. While they
can be just plain ordinary object, they can as well be data provided by <b>Pointer</b> or <b>Contract</b>.
In case of <b>Pointer</b>/<b>Contract</b> data can change without the need to rebind, but this is
only possible with <b>Active</b> binding. In this case, <b>Pointer</b>/<b>Contract</b> take
care of notifications what needs to be changed and how or even the fact if binding is possible (data
they can point could be <b>null</b> or simply object type that does not contain specified property which
makes binding impossible) 
</p>
<p>Binding source explained in simplest way is the main data origin point. Whenever you bind 
two properties there very slim possibility of every encountering situation when one side would
not be prevalent to another
</p>
<p>In case of binding, object being edited and widgets displaying/editing it are not of the same
importance. Object data is always based on him, while widget could as well display only selected
object.
</p>
<p><b>Source</b> is the prevalent side of the binding. Side that generates data persistence</p>
