<h1>What is flood detection and why would I care?</h1>
<a href="index.html">Back to main page</a>
<p>It is probably easier to explain why than what. If you have some event that constantly triggers
gui refresh, this is not really good sign for your work. Limiting that to bare minimum is first
step towards making application better. And gui is not the only point where one should be careful
about this. This is valid for any data binding in application and developer should know best what
is important and what not</p>
<p><b>What</b> is more complex as data flood can happen for many reasons and on many levels.
<b>g_data_binding_lib</b> tries its best to allow automatic detection on every possible level,
but the decision what is important and which solution is correct is solely responsability of
application</p>
<p>First step towards decision on which way is correct is analyzing the layer on which it
happens and then analyzing the smallest point of common interaction</p>
<p><b>Few examples of flood</b></p>
<li>If some widget is connected to signal which is constantly spammed when nature of application
does not demand that interface gets redrawn whole time</li>
<li>If static data pipeline tree is getting source change in fast intervals</li>
<li>If two widgets are bound and one of them changes its value</li>
<p><b>Solutions</b></p>
<p>As already said before <b>g_data_binding_lib</b> tries to allow solving this problem on every
possible level</p>
<li>You can solve it on property binding level when creating binding by specifiying <b>FLOOD_DETECTION</b></li>
<li>You can solve it on property binding level by having one binding that enables detection and then
use signals emitted on that binding to handle it manually</li>
<li>You can solve it on pointer level by wrapping your data root point into <b>ThrottlingBindingPointer</b></li>
<li>You can solve it on contract binding rules which allow first two solutions as well</li>
<p>Main thing is that there is no right solution to the problem and this differs from one problem to
another. Only thing that is sure is the need to find lowest common denominator and decide on the way
how this event should be presented to user.</p>
<p><b>Low level explanation of flood detection solution on PropertyBinding level</b></p>
<p><b>demo_and_tutorial</b> has example of solving this on <b>Passive</b> binding by tracking signals,
graying out label and changing title and then on flood stop restoring functionality back.</p>
<p>Note that flood in that demo is intentional.</p>

<p>Tutorial intentionally invokes too fast timer that is lasting while toggle button is active. But,
instead of constantly refreshing gui, this only happens 5 times</p>
<p><b>PropertyBinding</b> can be controlled to handle it exactly as application demands</p>
<li>by setting <b>promote_flood_limit</b> (default value is 5)</li>
<li>by setting <b>flood_interval</b> (default value is 100ms)</li>
<p>Binding in this case is really simple</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>	// flood detection enabled binding
	PropertyBinding basic4 = PropertyBinding.bind (demo, "counter", 
	                                               ui_builder.get_object ("basic_label_right4"), "label", 
	                                               BindFlags.FLOOD_DETECTION | BindFlags.SYNC_CREATE);
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>What this does is perfectly simple. Once it detects 5 too fast data changes it simply stops
promoting new data until one full interval without any data change occurs and then promotes last
change</p>
<p>The only problem with that is that gui either shows wrong information or just simply looks like it
locked up</p>
<p>This is why demo in that case uses two signals <b>flood_detected</b> and <b>flood_stopped</b> in
order to create correctly presented information which does not spam redraw, but rather informs user
about its temporarily stalled state</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>	public void flooded (BindingInterface binding)
	{
		((Gtk.Button) __ui_builder.get_object ("basic_label_right4")).sensitive = false;
		((Gtk.Label) __ui_builder.get_object ("basic_label_right4")).label = 
			"*** FLOODING *** last before freeze=>%i".printf(__demo._counter);
	}
	// ... code ...
	basic4.flood_detected.connect (flooded);
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>It connects to signal <b>flood_detected</b> and when signal is emitted it simply grays out the
label and sets its title to "*** FLOODING ***..."</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>	public void flood_over (BindingInterface binding)
	{
		((Gtk.Label) __ui_builder.get_object ("basic_label_right4")).sensitive = true;
	}
	// ... code ...
	basic4.flood_stopped.connect (flood_over);
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>To handle the even of <b>flood_over</b> things are simpler. All that it is needed to do is
ungraying of the label. Label title on the other hand is already correct since at the time of this
signal, data binding already emitted that last data change</p>
<p><b>Problem with this solution</b>. This is usable when only one connection is the problem. Doing
<b>FLOOD_DETECTION</b> on every binding is probably last thing that should be done... ever.</p>
<p><b>How to handle it correctly when more than one needs attention like this?</b></p>
<li>Use one single binding to detect flood, connect to its signals and then maintain everything from
that point. In most cases same flood is connected to more than one event.</li>
<li>Look up if this can be handled on upper level in case of <b>Active</b> bindings. In case of
<b>Active</b> bindings solving this on property level is the last thing that should be considered as
it is much more precise to control it trough pointer/contract unless this flood is happening on object
level</li>
<p><b>How to handle it on pointer/contract level?</b></p>
<p>This can be achieved by simply adding <b>ThrottlingBindingPointer</b> into your data tree as control
point. When done like this, you can assign data without single shred of concern to this aspect.
<b>ThrottlingBindingPointer</b> will simply stop promoting changes when it detects flood and assign
<b>null</b> as its current data. Second thing that it does is assigning <b>throttle_active</b> to <b>true</b>.
This makes it really easy to discern between <b>null</b> and <b>null</b> to show different correct state in
application.</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>	ThrottlingBindingPointer my_new_root_data_point = new ThrottlingBindingPointer (my_old_root_data_point);
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>All that is needed is one simple line of code and then using this new pointer as your tree root.</p>
<p>Note that even in case of <b>Active</b> bindings there are problems that need to be handled at property level. As said at
the beginning: <b>There is no right solution, there is only correct handling of situation</b></p>
