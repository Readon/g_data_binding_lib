<h1>What is reverse binding and what is its purpose</h1>

<p>While this seems useless in first glance, it is not. At least when using <b>Active</b> binding.
When you implement <b>Active</b> contract (group) bindings you often come to the point where one property needs to
flow in the other direction which would require creating extra contract. <b>REVERSE_DIRECTION</b> removes that need</p>
<p>Instead of creating workarounds or additional contract, it is much easier if <b>REVERSE_DIRECTION</b> rule is 
added to the existing one</p>
<p>In case of <b>Passive</b> binding, this probably has no use whatsoever since there it is probably much simpler to just swap 
arguments and be done with it.</p>
