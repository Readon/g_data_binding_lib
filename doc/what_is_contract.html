<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTES!!</b><p>
<p>Understanding <a href="what_is_pointer.html">BindingPointer</a> <b>is prerequisite for this topic.</b> <b>BindingContract</b> is
derived from it and as such inherits all its traits of how and when data is accessible or when it reacts to notifications</p>
<p>Same thing goes for understanding <a href="basic_explanation.html">Basic explanation of data binding</a>, where in this case
contract is pure example of <b>Active</b> data binding</p>
<h3>What is binding contract?</h3>
<p>In simplest term it is a <a href="what_is_pointer.html">BindingPointer</a> which adds contracted data functionality to pointers
data awareness.</p>
<p>Just like blank contracts in real life, <b>BindingContract</b> prepares the set of rules which must be followed when both parties
are specified and available for communication. In real life blank contract looks something like this, the only difference here is
that <b>BindingContract</b> is not one single element like in example. <b>BindingContract</b> is holding a group of contracts like
this one for each specific rule that has been imposed and since it is being derived from <b>BindingPointer</b> it also possesses
all the awareness to know when rules are possible and when not. As such main purpose of contract is just handling the activity of
specified rules in order to either make them effective or ineffective when conditions say so</p>

<p>In case of <b>BindingContract</b> this is simple. When any contract calls <b>bind(...)</b> it doesn't necessarily mean binding
is active. What it really means is that contract issued binding rule that will be used whenever possible and fills as many blanks
as possible. And it also means that this contract rule will be in effect whenever conditions are allowing for that (unless prevented
by application, which could as well suspend contract for some reason for some time duration)</p>
<p>If contract source (<b>data</b> property) is another contract or some binding pointer, there is no guarantee that data
being pointed out at the moment is there or that this will always be the case. And this is the reason why contract holds
its own set of rules of what to do and when</p>
<p>Due to the fact that that contract is derived from pointer, contract already has all the source awareness and notification
mechanism that is needed in order to fill most of the blanks and in case of source not being specified this is only blank
field in contract rule. In case of contract <b>bind(...)</b> call being done while contract is already knowing all the right
data, rule takes immediate effect.</p>
<h2>Q&A</h2>
<p><b>Q. Why BindingContract, why not just Contract?</b></p>
<p>A. Reason for that is simple. BindingContract handles bindings specifically, while contracts can be applied to many
other topics. Data binding is just one of them and this makes API cleaner.</p>
