<h1>What is custom data transfer?</h1>
<a href="index.html">Back to main page</a>
<p>Custom data transfer explained in simplest form is custom method used to convert data from one form to another
where standard conversions cannot do the job. <b>Note that examples here use PropertyBinding since at this point
Binder topic is still yet to be explained. Using Binder objects is defacto better method</b></p>
<blockquote><pre><code>	public delegate bool PropertyBindingTransformFunc (BindingInterface binding, Value source_value, ref Value target_value);
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>It has to be explained that <b>source_value</b> and <b>target_value</b> are not related to <b>source</b> and <b>target</b>.
<b>source_value</b> is always value that needs to be converted/translated in order to be assigned as <b>target_value</b>. This
means that if method was specifying translation from <b>target</b> to <b>source</b>, <b>source_value</b> will contain current value
of bound property in <b>target</b> and <b>target_value</b> will need to be filled with contents suitable for bound property in
<b>source</b>.</p>
<h2>Two ways of defining custom transfer</h2>
<li><b>Using standard GLib.Value conversion mechanism</b></li>
<p>In this case specified method converts between <b>source</b> and <b>target</b> GLib.Value and returns <b>true</b>.
In this case all the rest falls into binding responsability. Whenever translation method returns <b>true</b> binding
will internally assign <b>target</b> value to bound property</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>	PropertyBinding.bind (my_text_widget, "text", 
	                      my_label, "label", 
	                      BindFlags.SYNC_CREATE, 
		((b, src, ref tgt) => {
			tgt.set_string("value=" + src.get_string());
			return (true);
		}));
</code></pre></blockquote>
<li><b>Using direct assigning of value to destination</b></li>
<p>First requirement to do so is making sure that specified translation method returns <b>false</b> which stops
binding from trying to assign <b>target</b> value to bound property as it makes it look like translation didn't succeed.
At this point any manual assigning will take effect and it won't be overridden by binding internals.</p>
<p>In this case assigning/not assigning value is completely responsibility of this method.</p>
<p>This second method can come handy when all that you need is trigger to know when something needs to happen and 
translation method can do much more than just assigning the value it was supposed to.</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>	PropertyBinding.bind (ui_builder.get_object ("custom_binding_l2"), "text", 
	                      ui_builder.get_object ("custom_binding_r2"), "text", 
	                      BindFlags.SYNC_CREATE | BindFlags.BIDIRECTIONAL, 
		((binding, src, ref tgt) => {
			// in case when this would be known object assignment might as well be direct like
			// my_entry.text = my_other_entry.text
			((Gtk.Entry) binding.target).text = ((Gtk.Entry) binding.source).text;
			return (false);
		}),
		((binding, src, ref tgt) => {
			((Gtk.Entry) binding.source).text = ((Gtk.Entry) binding.target).text;
			return (false);
		}));
</code></pre></blockquote>
<h2>Registering transfer method on GLib level as custom transformation method</h2>
<p><b>Note!</b> When using first method it should be noted that GLib.Value has translation mechanism of its own which
can be used to specify translations globally.</p>
<p>Application can simply register GLib.Value translation method and be done with it.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>	GLib.Value.register_transform_func (typeof(string), typeof(bool), ((src, ref tgt) => {
		tgt.set_boolean ((src.get_string() != "") && (src.get_string() != null));
	}));
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>This code actively registers translation of <b>string</b> to <b>bool</b> and specifies that <b>bool</b> value
should be <b>true</b> whenever string is not <b>null</b> and not empty.</p>
<p>Problem with this is that application can sometimes have different conversions between same types. This can
as well be solved by defining your most needed as global transform function and supply correct conversion methods
in cases when this is not so.</p>
