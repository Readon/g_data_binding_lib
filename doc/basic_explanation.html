<h1>What is data binding?</h1>
<a href="index.html">Back to main page</a>

<p>Data binding when simplified is probably best described as having two points connected with set of rules and
those rules are what defines their synchronization. At this point data binding needs to be separated into two
groups <b>Active</b> and <b>Passive</b>. With <b>Passive</b> data bindings things are really simple. You connect
two objects and their properties and those get updated as defined. While it looks really simple, it is not so. 
Problem that arises with <b>Passive</b> data binding is that if you need to change connected object, you need to
drop all bindings and then manually reestablish them, while <b>Active</b> data binding takes care of that
internally. But, to understand <b>Active</b> data binding one must understand <b>Passive</b> first.
</p>
<p><b>All that said, Passive binding still has its uses</b>. If one wants to have tracked changes in list of
items represented in ListBox, creating <b>Active</b> binding for each item might be more of a burden than success.
Items in list will most probably be statical for whole life time and even more so, using <b>Passive</b> data
binding is much less straining on memory than <b>Active</b> which needs to store quite a bit more data in order
to sustain it self
</p>
<p><b><span style="color:red">IMPORTANT!</span></b> Even though it might look <b>Active</b> binding is better than <b>Passive</b> this is not the
case. They are equally useful and they each serve their own purposes. One of the most important things in data
binding is knowing which one to use when and to do that one needs to distinct between how they work and how they
maintain connection
</p>
<h3><b>Difference between Active and Passive data binding</b></h3>
<p><b>Passive</b> data binding is simple.
<li>Establish connection and the rules of it</li>
<li>Connection is active until either of connected parties reaches <b>EOL (end of life)</b> or until <b>unbind</b> is called</li>
<li><b>Problem:</b> When data binding is done or <b>Source</b> or <b>Target</b> needs to be changed everything 
needs to be reestablished manually for next editing, which makes it inconvenient for binding things to changing selection</li>
</p>
<p><b>Active</b> data binding is more complex on the other hand.
<li>First requirement for active data binding is having some sort of changeable data point like
<a href="what_is_contract.html">Contract</a></li>
<li>Establish connection between that active point and targets</li>
<li>At this point unlike <b>Passive</b> data binding, whenever <b>source</b> changes connection will be dropped
and reestablished automatically</li>
<li><b>Problem:</b> If this is repeated for every item in really long list, this amounts to quite a bit more
ram usage as necessary. <b>Active</b> binding needs to keep extra information on how to reestablish connection
back when connection changes</li>
</p>
<p><b><span style="color:red">How to know which one to use in specific case?</span></b>. This is simple... Question lifetime of object and 
<li>if lifetime is short lived where <b>source</b> point will change. Use <b>Active</b></li>
<li>if lifetime is long, use <b>Passive</b></li>
</p>
<p>Simplest example is application handling the list of items and allowing for modifications of them. List of items
is long term as widget displaying that list will always display the same list. Currently selected object which
allows for modifications is not as it can change with selection in list widget. This is why it is most efficient
to bind list items with <b>Passive</b>, create <a href="what_is_contract.html">Contract</a> which follows current
selection and bind editing widgets with <b>Active</b> on that contract.
</p>
<p>By doing this, application will use the least resources possible and result will be no different than it would be if
application was either using <b>Active</b> binding for every item or use <b>Passive</b> everywhere and manually
reestablish connection. The real difference is the amount of source and resources used which is required for either
approach to work. All <b>Active</b> will require about same amount of source as optimal, but require much more
ram than necessary, while going with all <b>Passive</b> will amount to few bytes less than optimal and end up with
a lot more source code than optimal.
</p>
<p><b><span style="color:red">IMPORTANT!</span></b> Note that both <b>Active</b> and <b>Passive</b> share exact same
<a href="binding_rules.html">Binding rules</a>
</p>
<h3><b>Passive data binding</b></h3>
<p>In most common scenario this is when some widget needs to display value of object property and dispatch its
notifications to object. This usually means that widget first needs to be loaded with data and then tracked for
all modifications and synchronized back to original object. This usually takes a lot of code to make it work as
it should.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Object person has property <b>name</b> and this needs to be displayed and edited in some entry widget. At the
start value of that property needs to be set to <b>text</b> property of entry widget, then (if changes needs to
be instant) one needs to connect to <b>changed</b> signal on that widget and set data back to object in that
signal handler or that needs to be taken care of when editing is done. In either case, responsibility is purely
on application. This doesn't even mention cases on how to handle when data is not present or editing is not
possible. But, the worst is when you add all these in application and end up with whole lot of code that is
crosslinked across whole application
</p>
<p>Person object definitely has more than one property and there is a good question how</p>
<p>With <b>Passive</b> data binding things are much simpler. All it takes is to <b>bind</b> (connect) them at 
editing start and then either <b>unbind</b> or wait until either of connected objects reaches its end of
life at which point binding is automatically unreferenced.
